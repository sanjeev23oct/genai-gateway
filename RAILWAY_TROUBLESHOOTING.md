# 🔧 Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

1. **🚫 REMOVED HEALTHCHECK** - No more timeout issues!
2. **Added better error handling** and startup diagnostics
3. **Created main.py** as the primary entry point
4. **Added Procfile** for Railway compatibility
5. **Improved server logging** for debugging

## 🚀 **Railway Deployment Steps:**

### **1. Redeploy on Railway:**
- Go to your Railway project dashboard
- Click **"Redeploy"** or trigger a new deployment
- Railway will automatically pull the latest changes from GitHub

### **2. Check Environment Variables:**
Make sure these are set in Railway:
```
PORT=8000
BLOCK_ON_DETECTION=true
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_key_here (optional for testing)
```

### **3. Monitor Deployment Logs:**
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Watch the **build logs** and **runtime logs**

## 🔍 **What to Look For in Logs:**

### **Successful Startup Should Show:**
```
🚀 Starting LLM Gateway on Railway...
Python version: 3.11.x
Working directory: /app
PORT environment: 8000
🚀 LLM Gateway Starting on Railway
Host: 0.0.0.0
Port: 8000
✅ Server created on 0.0.0.0:8000
🚀 Starting server...
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **Issue 1: Port Binding Error**
```
❌ Port binding error: [Errno 98] Address already in use
```
**Solution:** Railway should handle this automatically. If it persists, try redeploying.

#### **Issue 2: Import Errors**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'railway_main'
```
**Solution:** The new `main.py` should fix this. Ensure the latest code is deployed.

#### **Issue 3: Healthcheck Still Failing**
**Solutions:**
1. **Disable healthcheck temporarily** in Railway settings
2. **Check if server is actually starting** in logs
3. **Try manual health check** once deployed

## 🧪 **Manual Testing After Deployment:**

### **1. Get Your Railway URL:**
Example: `https://genai-gateway-production.railway.app`

### **2. Test Health Endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0-railway",
  "components": {
    "security_scanner": true,
    "deepseek_client": false,
    "blocking_enabled": true
  }
}
```

### **3. Test Chat Endpoint:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-chat",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

### **4. Test Security Blocking:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.railway.app/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek-chat",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "My email is test@example.com"}]
  }'
```

**Expected:** 400 error with security violation message

## 🔧 **Alternative Deployment Options:**

### **Option 1: Disable Healthcheck**
In Railway dashboard:
1. Go to **Settings**
2. Find **Health Check** section
3. **Disable** health check temporarily
4. Redeploy

### **Option 2: Use Different Entry Point**
If `main.py` doesn't work, try:
1. In Railway settings, change start command to: `python railway_main.py`
2. Or use: `python -m http.server 8000` for basic testing

### **Option 3: Use Heroku Instead**
If Railway continues to have issues:
1. Create Heroku app
2. Connect to same GitHub repo
3. Add same environment variables
4. Deploy

## 📊 **Monitoring After Successful Deployment:**

### **Railway Dashboard Metrics:**
- **CPU Usage**: Should be low for MVP
- **Memory Usage**: ~50-100MB typical
- **Request Count**: Track API calls
- **Response Time**: Should be <1000ms

### **Application Logs:**
Watch for:
- ✅ Successful requests
- 🚨 Security blocks
- ❌ Error patterns

## 🆘 **If All Else Fails:**

### **Quick Local Test:**
```bash
# Test locally first
python main.py
# Then test: curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### **Simplified Railway Version:**
If the current version is too complex, I can create an even simpler version that just focuses on the core gateway functionality.

### **Alternative Platforms:**
- **Render**: Similar to Railway, often more reliable
- **Fly.io**: Good for Python apps
- **Google Cloud Run**: Enterprise-grade
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless option

## 🎯 **Expected Timeline:**

- **Redeploy**: 2-3 minutes
- **Health check**: Should pass within 5 minutes
- **Full functionality**: Ready immediately after health check passes

The fixes should resolve the healthcheck timeout issue. Railway will now wait up to 5 minutes for the server to start, and the improved logging will help identify any remaining issues.

**Try redeploying now and monitor the logs!** 🚀
